# Personal Portfolio
Hey! I'm building my personal portfolio and hosting it with GH, check it out: [norwegianlamb's portfolio](https://norwegianlamb.github.io/)

I'm integrating Three.js too, I would like to use a 3D model as a visual representation of which section of the website you're visiting.

## Current status:
Work in progress
